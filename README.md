## Covid-19 Prediction using X-Rays

###### ABSTRACT
The **Covid-19 (also known as SARS-COV-2)** that first occurred in Wuhan, 2019 which spread around the whole world like a wildfire. This contagious disease spreads from person to person through direct contact to another. The effects of Covid-19 can be classified into different scales from mild to severe. At the time of writing this paper a total of 148 million cases and 3.1 million deaths are confirmed. Most of the Covid-19 detection are done with RT-PCR tests which generally take time. Depending the critical scenarios and demands it might even take longer. For a contagious disease like covid-19 the main goal is to restrict itâ€™s spread. So, with the help of Machine Learning and Deep Learning Algorithms that are built on Radiology images could help in making the decisions for diagnosis of Covid-19 patients. We proposed in using Transfer-Learning based model for Covid-19 Detection using chest x-ray, because of the scarcity of available data. We performed Transfer Learning approach in order to obtain reliable results which could help us with smaller dataset. Though the x-rays do not provide maximum confirmation we rely the minimal percentage of chance that could help in reducing the spread of Covid-19. The process consists of two phases where in the first we pre-process the images and in the second we train and finetune the model to achieve desirable accuracy of the model.

Publicly available **X-ray images (1583 healthy and 712 confirmed COVID-19) AND (712 COVID-19, 4273 Pneumonia and 1583 Normal)** were used in the experiments, which involved the training of deep learning and machine learning classifiers. 5 custom CNN (Convolution Neural Network) experiments were, and 5 experiments for both categorical and binary were performed using Transfer Learning Models with ImageNet set as weights.
